# Sonos 4 Android TV Public Information

Welcome to Sonos 4 Android TV. The App is designed to work with the excellent Sonos system and be a companion (not replacement) to the official Sonos Apps. The focus is on providing media rich displays on your TV for tracks playing on your Sonos system.

* Connection is to a single Sonos speaker (ideally the same room as the TV)
* Usage is limited to 1 hour a day while services are monitored
* This is a personal project used to try out Android TV development
* More features will be added as time allows

If you find a problem or have an idea please share by raising an Issue (please check if there is already one before raisng anything new)

If you are interested in translating the App to a non-English language then please raise an issue and I will look at making the required files available. (As the app develops there will be more text strings to update, so please keep that in mind before volunteering - all translations offered are on a free of charge and no commitment agreement)
